# Solutions to the online version of "Learn Prolog Now!"
I did not have access to the paperback version of this text and so was unable to check my answers to the exercises. 
URL: http://www.learnprolognow.org/index.php. I found some solutions online and decided to post my versions as they differ slightly or the git repositories I found did not include the questions as well. I also included the practical answers that seem to work for me.
